The Ocular Diseases Inhibiting Vision, Has Been Abruptly Proliferating Due to Human Evolution. One Such Vision Threatening Malady Is Glaucoma, Caused In the Optic Nerve That May Lead to Sudden Blindness. Ophthalmologist(s) Utilize Copious Methodologies to Detect the Disease But the Accuracy Is Constrained Due To Humane Limitation. There Has Been an Indagation for Recognizing Glaucoma Utilizing Machine Learning & Deep Learning Model(s) With Varied Ideation(s) But the Efficacy Isn’t Apt for Such Cardinal Affliction. Here, We Have Collated Various Deep Learning Architectures Based On Diverse Parameter(s), Such as MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, & VGG16, Appealed Over 02-Classes Categorizing It to ‘G’ & ‘NG’. The Data Has Been Aggregated from Various Sources & Pre-Processed for Potent Proficiency. This Modus Operandi Gave Us Phenomenal Result(s) With High Veracity.
